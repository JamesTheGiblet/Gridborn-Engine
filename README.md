🕹️ GRIDBORN PROTOCOL

AModular 8-Bit Arena Engine for Sovereign Combat

“In the compressed grid, only the mythic endure. Every trail is a lineage. Every crash, a ritual.”

🔮 Overview
Gridborn Protocol is a tactical, 8-bit combat engine where players pilot mythic vehicles across compressed arenas, leaving deadly trails and invoking pixel-bound rituals. Inspired by TRON, Advance Wars, and sovereign builder philosophy, this system fuses retro aesthetics with modular depth.

Built for expansion, lore, and community co-authorship, Gridborn is not just a game—it’s a ritualized battlefield of movement, memory, and myth.

🧱 Core Features
Modular Vehicle Classes: Motorcycles, tanks, planes, ships, and more—each with unique movement, trail logic, and combat roles.
Compressed Grid Combat: Small grids (8×8 to 16×16) amplify tactical density and trail saturation.
Trail-Based Warfare: Every move leaves a trail; every trail is a weapon.
Obstacles & Terrain: Walls, warp nodes, fog tiles, and sigil gates shape the battlefield.
Power-Ups & Power-Downs: Blessings and curses that shift momentum mid-match.
Mythic Lore System: Vehicles, arenas, and pickups are named, storied, and scroll-bound.
8-Bit Aesthetic: Pixel sprites, chiptune FX, and golden-ratio glyphs.

🚗 Vehicle Classes
Each vehicle is a Sigil Vessel, forged by ancient builders and defined by:

Movement Pattern: Speed, turn logic, grid interaction
Trail Behavior: Length, fade rate, collision effect
Combat Role: Zoner, flanker, disruptor, defender
Class	Speed	Trail Type	Role	Lore Name
Motorcycle	Fast	Thin, long	Agile	Flickerblade
Tank	Slow	Thick, short	Zoner	Iron Sigil
Plane	Medium	Air trail	Flanker	Skybrand
Spaceship	Warp	Phased trail	Disruptor	Void Sovereign
Ship	Slow	Wake trail	Defender	Tidewarden
Mech Walker	Heavy	Footstep trail	Bruiser	Echo Stomp

🗺️ Arena System
Arenas are Scroll Maps, each defined by:

Grid Size: 8×8, 12×12, 16×16
Terrain Tiles: Road, water, sky, warp zones
Obstacles: Walls, gates, mines, fog, mirrors
Dynamic Events: Gridfolding, collapsing zones, ritual triggers
