# The Gridborn Engine: A Blueprint for Pure Tactical Combat

The grid is the field. The trail is the weapon.

üß† Core Philosophy

The Gridborn Engine is not a game; it is a tactical protocol. It‚Äôs a blueprint for a dialectic of space and consequence, built for emergent strategy. Its core principles are simple and direct:

    The Law of Spatial Discipline: All conflict is contained within a small grid. This constraint forces deliberate, dense decisions, where every move has immediate and predictable consequences.

    The Law of Traceability: The act of movement itself creates the primary hazard and strategic tool. The trail becomes a permanent record of past actions, forcing a constant negotiation with history.

    The Law of Modular Purity: All components‚Äîfrom vehicles to effects‚Äîare defined solely by their mechanical properties. They are archetypes of movement, not narrative artifacts, ensuring that every piece of the engine is testable, predictable, and devoid of aesthetic clutter.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

Emoji	Name	What It Is
ü™û	The Vehicle Logic	Vehicles are living constructs, defined by their modular behavior: movement, trail type, and collision response.
üè∞	The Arena Citadel	The battleground is a dynamic, procedurally defined space where walls and pickups are deliberate parts of the tactical design.
‚ú®	The Catalyst of Change	A system for triggering powerful, time-limited effects that can dramatically alter the state of the grid, from "Grid Flips" to "Trail Surges."
ü§ñ	The Strategic Automaton	An AI system that operates on a clear, deterministic decision tree, allowing for isolated testing and predictable bot opponents.
‚õìÔ∏è	The Peer-to-Peer Weave	Multiplayer is built on a peer-to-peer foundation, ensuring low-latency, direct conflict without a central authority.

üöÄ Quick Start

To awaken the engine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites:

    Rust 1.70+

    A recent version of cargo

Installation:
Bash

# Clone the tactical forge
git clone https://github.com/gridborn/engine.git
cd engine
# Build the core construct
cargo build --release

Basic Usage:

Run the example duel scenario to see the protocol in action:
Bash

# Initiate a test duel
cargo run --example duel

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Arenas are defined by a simple .grid file format, allowing for the quick construction of new tactical scenarios. This allows you to act as an arena architect.

[arena]
size = "12x12"
walls = ["(3,3)", "(3,4)", "(3,5)"]
pickups = ["speed_boost@5,5"]

üìä How It Works

    The Architect's Command: Generate a new arena with a unique wall layout to test a specific tactical scenario.

    The Strategist's Query: Isolate a specific AI module and run it against a benchmarked scenario to measure its tactical efficiency.

    The Weaver's Test: Implement a new Phased trail type and verify its interaction with all existing collision rules.

üß¨ Contributing

We invite you to join the Architects of the Gridborn Engine. Contributions are not just about adding features; they are about upholding the core philosophy of clarity, determinism, and modularity.

The Guilds of Gridborn:

    The Weaver: For those who will craft new Vehicle or Effect modules, ensuring they adhere to the law of modular purity.

    The Cartographer: For those who will design new .grid arenas, exploring the tactical possibilities of the constrained space.

    The Oracle: For those who will refine the AI decision trees and test them for perfect, deterministic behavior.

Contribution Flow:

    Fork the repository.

    Adhere to the core principles: no aesthetic drift, no hackable lore, only testable mechanics.

    Submit a Pull Request for review.

üèüÔ∏è The Trials

We test new additions not just with unit tests, but with trials designed to prove their tactical integrity.

    The Architect's Gauntlet: A trial where a new arena must be proven to be free of unintended deterministic loops or dead-ends.

    The Duel of the Golems: A test where a new Vehicle or Effect module must face a series of known AI bots and maintain its predictable behavior.

    The Trial of Purity: An audit to ensure a new contribution has not introduced any non-deterministic or obscure logic.

üó∫Ô∏è The Roadmap of the Engine

The Gridborn Engine is a living protocol, not a finished product. Our journey is defined by the quest for greater purity and tactical depth.

    Current: Fortifying the core AI system and fixing critical known issues.

    Next Phase: Expanding the Effect system with new, deterministic catalysts.

    Future: Exploring new multiplayer paradigms and AI benchmarks.

‚öñÔ∏è Risk Disclaimer

The Gridborn Engine is a purely mechanical framework. Its sole purpose is to model deterministic combat. The interactions within it are predictable, but the strategies that emerge from them are complex and cannot be guaranteed.

üôè Acknowledgments

We stand on the shoulders of digital giants like TRON and other grid-based games, whose simplicity laid the foundation for the tactical elegance we seek to achieve.

üß≠ Call to Adventure

"The elegance of the grid is its honesty. You cannot hide. You can only move with intention."

Do not come seeking narrative or fantasy. Come seeking a pure tactical challenge, a machine of perfect logic, and a forge for strategic mastery.

Enter the grid and prove your intent.
