Gridborn Engine

Gridborn Engine is a tactical combat framework for grid-based trail games. Inspired by the elegance of TRON-style mechanics, it enforces spatial discipline, modular extensibility, and deterministic gameplay. Designed for clarity, not complexity.

ðŸŽ¯ Design Philosophy

- Small Grid Constraint: All arenas are 8Ã—8 to 16Ã—16. This enforces tactical density, short decision loops, and predictable collision zones.
- Trail-Based Combat: Movement leaves trails. Trails are the primary hazard and strategic tool.
- Modular Vehicles: Vehicles are defined by movement logic, trail behavior, and collision response. No lore, no fluffâ€”just mechanics.

ðŸ§© Core Modules

1. Vehicle System

Vehicles are composed of three modules:

| Module         | Description                                      | Example Values             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Movement Logic | How the vehicle moves per tick                   | Orthogonal, Diagonal, Warp |
| Trail Type     | Behavior of the trail left behind                | Solid, Phased, Delayed     |
| Collision Rule | What happens on trail or wall collision          | Explode, Bounce, Phase     |

Phased Trail: Appears intermittently (e.g. every 2 ticks), allowing partial traversal. It alters collision logic and strategic planning.

`rust
trait Vehicle {
  fn tick(&mut self, grid: &mut Grid);
  fn trail_behavior(&self) -> TrailType;
  fn on_collision(&self, other: &TrailType) -> CollisionResult;
}
`

2. Arena System

Arenas are defined by:

- Grid Size: 8Ã—8 to 16Ã—16
- Wall Layout: Static or dynamic
- Pickup Zones: Optional modifiers (e.g. speed, trail type)

Example .grid file:

`toml
[arena]
size = "12x12"
walls = ["(3,3)", "(3,4)", "(3,5)"]
pickups = ["speed_boost@5,5"]
`

Rendering is tile-based. Movement is discrete and deterministic.

---

3. Effects System

Effects are triggered by:

- Trail interactions
- Pickup collisions
- Arena triggers

Examples:

- Trail Surge: Temporarily doubles trail length
- Grid Flip: Rotates arena 90Â° mid-match
- Echo Pulse: Reveals opponent trail for 3 ticks

`rust
trait Effect {
  fn trigger(&self, context: &GameState) -> EffectResult;
}
`

---

4. AI System

Bots operate on a tactical decision tree:

- Scan Grid: Identify safe paths
- Predict Opponent: Estimate next 2 moves
- React: Choose movement that avoids collision and maximizes trail coverage

`rust
fn choose_move(state: &GameState) -> Direction;
`

AI modules are testable in isolation and benchmarked against deterministic scenarios.

ðŸš« Removed Features

- No hackable lore systems
- No fantasy naming conventions
- No player-side scripting
- No narrative modules

Gridborn Engine is a tactical protocol, not a sandbox. Every mechanic is deterministic, every module is teachable, and every subsystem is designed for clarity.
